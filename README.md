# EatIn/EatOut

This application uses Edamam API and Zomato API. The Edamam API helps users search recipes.  The Zomato API helps users search restaurants in any city that they choose.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

If you get a search you do not like, you can search a new recipe.
